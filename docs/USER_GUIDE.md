## Scoring System

### How Points Are Calculated

The Quiz Quest Vibe scoring system is designed to reward both accuracy and speed, encouraging students to answer correctly while maintaining a reasonable pace.

#### Base Points

Each question has a predefined point value set by the teacher:

- **High-value questions**: 1000 points (typically for harder or more important questions)
- **Medium-value questions**: 800 points (standard difficulty)
- **Low-value questions**: 500 points (easier or quick-fire questions)

#### Speed Multiplier

Points are awarded based on how quickly you answer correctly:

- **Faster answers earn more points**: The quicker you respond correctly, the higher percentage of the base points you receive
- **Time penalty**: Slower responses receive a reduced percentage of the base points
- **No points for wrong answers**: Incorrect answers receive 0 points regardless of speed
- **Time limit**: If you don't answer before the timer runs out, you receive 0 points

#### Streak System

Consecutive correct answers build a streak multiplier that significantly boosts your score:

1. **Building Streaks**

   - Each consecutive correct answer increases your streak counter
   - Streak multiplier increases with longer streaks
   - Maximum streak bonus can significantly multiply your points

2. **Streak Bonuses**

   - **1-2 correct answers**: No bonus (1x multiplier)
   - **3-4 correct answers**: Small bonus (1.1x multiplier)
   - **5-6 correct answers**: Medium bonus (1.25x multiplier)
   - **7+ correct answers**: Large bonus (1.5x multiplier)

3. **Streak Reset**
   - Wrong answers reset your streak to 0
   - Missing a question (time runs out) also resets your streak
   - Streaks start fresh with each new quiz

#### Example Scoring Calculation

**Question 1**: 1000 base points

- Answered correctly in 5 seconds (fast) = 950 points
- Current streak: 1 (no multiplier)
- **Final score**: 950 points

**Question 2**: 800 base points

- Answered correctly in 8 seconds (medium speed) = 720 points
- Current streak: 2 (no multiplier)
- **Final score**: 720 points

**Question 3**: 1000 base points

- Answered correctly in 3 seconds (very fast) = 980 points
- Current streak: 3 (1.1x multiplier)
- **Final score**: 980 Ã— 1.1 = 1,078 points

### Leaderboard Rankings

#### During the Quiz

- **Real-time updates**: Scores update immediately after each question
- **Live rankings**: See your position relative to other students
- **Streak display**: Current streak counter visible to maintain motivation

#### Final Rankings

Students are ranked by:

1. **Total points** (primary ranking factor)
2. **Answer accuracy** (secondary factor for tie-breaking)
3. **Average response time** (tertiary factor for tie-breaking)

#### Teacher Analytics

Teachers can view detailed scoring breakdowns including:

- Individual student performance question-by-question
- Time taken for each response
- Streak progression throughout the quiz
- Points earned per question with speed analysis

### Strategic Tips for Students

#### Maximizing Your Score

1. **Balance speed and accuracy**: Fast wrong answers hurt more than slightly slower correct answers
2. **Protect your streak**: Be extra careful when you have a long streak going
3. **Don't rush early questions**: Build confidence with accurate answers first
4. **Stay focused**: Maintain concentration throughout to preserve streaks

#### Understanding the Display

- **Current Score**: Your total points accumulated so far
- **Current Streak**: Number of consecutive correct answers
- **Question Points**: Base points available for the current question
- **Time Remaining**: Visual timer showing remaining response time

### Code Implementation

The scoring system is implemented in the server-side code (`server.js`). Here's how the points are calculated:

```javascript
// From server.js - calculateScore function
function calculateScore(basePoints, timeLimit, timeTaken, streak) {
  // Speed multiplier: faster answers get more points
  const speedMultiplier = Math.max(0.3, 1 - (timeTaken / timeLimit) * 0.7);

  // Base score with speed bonus
  let score = Math.round(basePoints * speedMultiplier);

  // Streak multiplier
  let streakMultiplier = 1;
  if (streak >= 7) {
    streakMultiplier = 1.5;
  } else if (streak >= 5) {
    streakMultiplier = 1.25;
  } else if (streak >= 3) {
    streakMultiplier = 1.1;
  }

  // Apply streak bonus
  score = Math.round(score * streakMultiplier);

  return score;
}

// Answer processing (simplified)
socket.on("answer", (data) => {
  const { questionId, answer, timeTaken } = data;
  const question = room.questions[room.currentQuestion];
  const isCorrect = answer === question.correctAnswer;

  if (isCorrect) {
    // Update streak
    player.streak += 1;

    // Calculate score
    const score = calculateScore(
      question.points,
      question.timeLimit,
      timeTaken,
      player.streak
    );

    player.score += score;
  } else {
    // Reset streak on wrong answer
    player.streak = 0;
  }
});
```

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Speed Calculation**: `speedMultiplier = Math.max(0.3, 1 - (timeTaken / timeLimit) * 0.7)`

   - Minimum 30% of points even for slowest correct answers
   - Linear decrease based on time taken vs time limit

2. **Streak Bonuses**: Applied as multipliers after speed calculation

   - 3-4 streak: 1.1x multiplier
   - 5-6 streak: 1.25x multiplier
   - 7+ streak: 1.5x multiplier

3. **Score Updates**: Scores are calculated server-side and broadcast to all clients in real-time

4. **Streak Management**: Incremented on correct answers, reset to 0 on wrong answers or timeouts
